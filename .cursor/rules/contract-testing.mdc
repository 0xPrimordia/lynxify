# Deploy before running tests

deploy updates to the contract to testnet before running tests or you will not see your changes.

Context: given this project's requirements and Hedera's architecture, the current approach of deploying to testnet for tests is actually the recommended way to ensure your contract works correctly with all Hedera-specific features.
