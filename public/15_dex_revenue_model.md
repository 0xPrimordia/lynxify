# DEX Revenue Model

Lynxify's DEX offers advanced trading features and tools designed to enhance user experience and optimize trading strategies. Our revenue model is centered around a subscription-based approach for premium features.

## Revenue Streams

| Revenue Stream          | Description                                           | Projected Revenue |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Subscription Fees**   | $12/month for access to premium features, including AI tools and automated trading strategies. | TBD               |

## Premium Features

- **AI Trading Tools:** Leverage advanced AI algorithms to optimize trading decisions and strategies.
- **Automated Trading Strategies:** Access to sophisticated auto trading features, including threshold trading without per-transaction fees.

## Operational Considerations

- **Threshold Trading Costs:** Includes gas fees and worker service hosting. These costs are covered by the subscription model, eliminating the need for per-transaction fees.
- **AI Integration Costs:** Based on CryptoRobotics' API pricing:
  - **1st Month:** Testing on a hidden release.
  - **2nd and 3rd Months:** Subscription price = your price + 20% referral payments. You receive 100% from sales.
  - **4th+ Months:** Subscription price = your price + 20% referral payments + 10% to CryptoRobotics.
- **Service Integration:** Utilizing platforms like [CryptoRobotics Developer API](https://cryptorobotics.ai/developer-api/) to enhance feature offerings and maintain operational efficiency.

## Financial Outlook

- **Scalability:** As user adoption increases, subscription revenue is expected to grow, offsetting operational costs and contributing to overall profitability.
- **User Retention:** The subscription model encourages long-term engagement, providing a stable revenue stream.
